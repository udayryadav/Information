SAGA Design pattern
Event Driven service choreography (Microservices uses)
`BPMN` --> Provide certain workflow to handle business process.


Problem in microservices
  1. Sync of data between different database servers (overcome using messaging pattern)
  2. Event driven architecture
  3. Scaling side
  4. Security (API Gateway provides different services to overcome sercurity issue)
  5. Versioning 
  6. API Discovery (Netflix Eureka)
  
  How service discovery is working ?
  
  7. Data Staleness - The database should be always updated to given recent data. the API will fetch data from the recent and update database.
  
  8. Debugging and Logging - There are multiple solution for this, by pushing log messages to an correlation ID can be provided by the client in order to achive this.
